* This is a function that reads data from 5 sensors measurements, and calculates several statistic values,plots etc.
*All files in this folder are needed for the code to run properly.
*Short description of the code:
#import scipy as stats
#read data, in dataframe
#Stats for dataset HEATA,B,C,D,E
#Temperature variable of the datasets,histogram
#frequency polygons
#boxplots for WindDirection,WindSpeed,Temperature of the 5 sensors
#PMF, 5 sensors Temperature
#PDF, 5 sensors Temperature
#CDF, 5 sensors Temperature
#PDF, 5 sensors Wind Speed, with Kernel Density Estimation
#Correlations, 5 sensors Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe & Crosswind Speed
#Interpolation of sensors' data
#Coefficients of sensors' data
#Coeffs scatter plots
#CDF, Wind Speed of the 5 sensors
#def mean_confidence_interval
#function that sorts and finds hottest and coolest days of the datasets
